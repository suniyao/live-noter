Core Conventions

* I use Markdown for structure:

  * Headers (##, ###, ####) indicate hierarchy.
  * Each note usually starts with metadata like:
    2025-MM-DD HH:MM
    Status: ...
    Tags: #topic #subtopic
* I use "> " for emphasis or reflections (like side comments, quotes, or conclusions).
* "==highlighted text==" marks something important or conceptually central.

Math Formatting

* Math is always written in LaTeX between double dollar signs (`$$`), not inline math mode.
  Example:
  $$ f(x) = \int_a^b g(t) dt $$
* I often use:
  $\implies, \forall, \exists, \lVert \rVert, \mathbb{R}, \vec{v}$.
  Lowercase variables for functions and signals (like x[n], f(t)).
  Square brackets [n] for discrete time signals. Uppercase variables for sets.
* When I define terms, they’ll look like:
  Definition:
  $$ x[n] = \sin(2π f_0 nT) $$

Code and Technical Blocks

* Code snippets use triple backticks with a language label, like:

  ```python
  def f(x):
      return x**2
  ```

  Replace "python" with "curl", "c++", etc. depending on context.
  These are not equations even if they look algebraic.
* When I write pseudocode, I might omit the language label entirely.

Tone and Style

* My notes are semi-formal:
  I mix academic explanations with personal reactions (like “LMAO”, “wait what??”, “so this means…”).
  I often explain reasoning step-by-step.
  I might leave unfinished thoughts if the transcript ends mid-sentence — treat them as incomplete, not errors.
